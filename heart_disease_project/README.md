**Description of the Dataset:**

The dataset focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients. We will use this dataset to predict which patients are most likely to suffer from heart disease in the near future using the given features. It contains 14 attributes including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar levels, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, old peak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, Thallium, and the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

The dataset is publicly available in the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository and has been used extensively for research purposes. It provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating predictive models for heart disease.
